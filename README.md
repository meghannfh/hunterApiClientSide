# The Hunter x Hunter Database
This project that displays character data from the popular manga and anime, Hunter x Hunter made using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
Data used for this project is hosted on MongoDB.

## Purpose
This project was primarily built to better understand the following:
* build a Node.js and Express.js API
* set up and use MongoDB Atlas
* manipulate JSON objects to obtain information
* dislpay information from a DB to the DOM
* exercise my understanding of basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS

## Updates
In the future, there is a possibility of adding a route to display all characters in the database at once.

## Contributing
Feel free to add any functionality you think the application is lacking!
